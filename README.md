# LEDE PROJECT 1 ANALYSIS
### The Gilmore Girls Literary Canon
Completed project can be found [here]("nguyenkim.ca/data-viz/gg/gilmores")

## 1. Project Motivations

In 2022 I took my first ever D3 course, and ***had no idea what was going on.*** This project was basically the perfect excuse to consolidate everything using a dataset with nice sample size in the hundreds. Even though book data isn't as accessible as previously (RIP Goodreads), it's still readily available and relatively easy to obtain if you're willing to poke around. 

Technical aspects aside, the subject matter is interesting to me (books), and I thought it would be stylistically fun to apply it to Gilmore Girls, a show about books.

## 2. Findings 
The project's hypothesis posits what type of books do the Gilmores read, and how does the practice of reading play into the broader culture they exist in?
 
By parsing through the series' literary canon, we have a rich amount of data that quantifies the Gilmores' reading habits in a qualitative context â€” from the data, it turns out the characters in the Gilmore-verse are pretty much game for anything but generally stick to titles released in the 20th and 21st centuries. 

Because the data was so heavily skewed towards the most recent two centuries, I employed both an exponential and linear scale to represent the graph
